# how-would-they-react
This is a fun project to try to build a sample application using local LLM (Local Language Model) and GPT-3. The idea is to build a simple application that can take a user input and generate a response based on the input. The application will be built using Ollama and React as the front end.

## Setup Ollama using Docker Desktop

## Create a React App using Create React App

```bash

npx create-react-app my-celebrity-app --template typescript

```

### Add Axios fr amking API calls

```bash

npm install axios

```
